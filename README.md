Maybe we don't fully test the code,so some function may work just the most time,but in some extreme cases,it may have some mistakes.

And from the notes of homework ,what i get the meaning of the immutable and the mutable one it that:
1.The mutable one is that we can change the linklist itself.
2.The immutable one is that we should keep the orginal one and we change its copy and return the copy.
